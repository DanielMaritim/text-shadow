# text-shadow

a simple repo about adding text shadow with css3

The text-shadow CSS property adds shadows to text. It accepts a comma-separated list of shadows to be applied to the text and any of its decorations . Each shadow is described by some combination of X and Y offsets from the element, blur radius, and color.

You can simply use the CSS text-shadow property to apply the shadow effect on text elements. You can also apply more than one shadow (applied front-to-back) through providing a comma-separated list of shadows.
